## **Architecture and Algorithms**

### **Architecture Overview**
- **Frontend**:
  - Built with React.js for an interactive and responsive user experience.
  - Uses Web Speech API for voice input.
- **Backend**:
  - Powered by FastAPI for high performance and scalability.
  - Utilizes GPT-4 via OpenAI API for language processing.
- **Deployment**:
  - Dockerized services for containerized deployment.
  - Managed by GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

### **Key Algorithms and Techniques**
#### **1. Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**
- GPT-4 processes queries with high contextual understanding.
- Optimized prompt engineering ensures domain-specific precision.

#### **2. Voice-to-Text Conversion**
- Web Speech API converts user voice input into text.
- Handles background noise and varying accents effectively.

#### **3. Multi-Turn Conversations**
- Context tracking for coherent responses in multi-turn scenarios.
- Example:
  - **User**: "What is the capital of France?"
  - **Assistant**: "The capital of France is Paris."
  - **User**: "What’s its population?"
  - **Assistant**: "As of 2023, the population of Paris is approximately 2.1 million."
